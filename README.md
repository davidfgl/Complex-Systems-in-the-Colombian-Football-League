# üìä Colombian Football League - Systems Analysis Project

Welcome to the **Colombian Football League Systems Analysis Project** repository! This repository contains all the key materials for our analysis of the Colombian football league as a complex system, including slides, technical documents, and a poster formatted in IEEE standards. 

## üìÅ Repository Structure

- **Slides:** A brief and concise presentation covering general system representation, sensitivity analysis, system complexity, and emergent behaviors. Focused on the Colombian football league.
- **Technical Report:** A detailed analysis of the Colombian football league, including system elements, processes, interactions, and sensitivity analysis.
- **Research Paper:** A comprehensive study applying systems theory concepts such as chaos theory, synergy, entropy, and the butterfly effect to the league.
- **Poster:** A visual representation of our research following IEEE format standards, summarizing key findings and concepts.

## üìë Project Overview

The Colombian football league is analyzed through the lens of **systems theory**. The project applies various complex systems concepts such as:

- **Chaos Theory** üåÄ: How small events (e.g., an expulsion or last-minute goal) lead to large, unpredictable consequences.
- **Butterfly Effect** ü¶ã: Tiny changes, like an injury or a key decision, result in a cascading series of impacts across the league.
- **Domino Effect** üé≤: Financial crises or mismanagement in one team ripple through the entire league system, affecting competition and resources.

### Key Components Analyzed:
- **System Elements:** Teams, players, fans, sponsors, media, and governing bodies.
- **System Interactions:** Financial management, sports performance, media coverage, and fan engagement.
- **Emergent Behaviors:** Unexpected patterns, such as collective performance surpassing individual capabilities or cycles of success driven by positive feedback.
